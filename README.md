Data and scripts for mBio 2023 Roller et al. Single-cell mass distributions reveal simple rules for achieving steady-state growth

Each R script corresponds to 1 or more data file(s) in csv format, which together regenerate the figures and analyses in the paper. Scripts and data files are named after their corresponding figures or supplemental figures. Please note that in the R scripts, the load data section will require the user to either: 1) store the R scripts and data files in the same directory, 2) adjust the filename to include the path to the stored data file or 3) reset the working directory to the path where the data file is stored.
